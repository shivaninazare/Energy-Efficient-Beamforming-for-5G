# Energy-efficient-beamforming-for-5g
### Simulation of energy efficient beamforming for 5g network using MATLAB

The proposed model consists of two main modules namely Antenna Array generation and adding of Channel Model.

The main objectives of Antenna Array Generation module are:
• Increased directivity
• Improved F/B Ratio
• Minimized Interference
• Amplitude Tapering

The main objectives of Channel modelling module are :
• Selecting the Channel model: To find the most realistic yet efficient channel model.
• Increased Received power

### The Optimized antennae array.mat file contains the optmized 2\*2 antennae array data. The optmized antenna.m file contains the matlab code for the 2\*2 antennae array which gives the directivity value 16.7 and F/B ratio 37.3 dB.
### The channel model.txt file should be typed on the command window . This contains the ray tracing channel model code for evaluating our antennae array performance.
