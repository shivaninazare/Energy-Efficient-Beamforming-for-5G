# Energy-efficient-beamforming-for-5g
### This project is about the simulation of energy efficient beamforming for 5g network using MATLAB such that the transmitted beam must be energy efficient and received powerof the beam must be strong.
### The Optimized antennae array.mat file contains the optmized 2\*2 antennae array data. The optmized antenna.m file contains the matlab code for the 2\*2 antennae array which gives the directivity value 16.7 and F/B ratio 37.3 dB.
### The channel model.txt file should be typed on the command window . This contains the ray tracing channel model code for evaluating our antennae array performance.
